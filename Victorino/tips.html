      <h1>“Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”</h1>
      <p>
        As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people
        who are fully vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy.
        But Dr. Cardona warns that now still

        “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series
        as recommended for the best protection against severe complications such
        as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% protection
        against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the
        infectious consequences of being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”

      <h1>
        Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,
        including other vaccinated people?
      </h1>
      <p>
        While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit
        COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds that this could also be a
        reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.

        “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those
        with underlying health disorders may not have the best protective
        response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still
        collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses
        in these vulnerable populations.”
