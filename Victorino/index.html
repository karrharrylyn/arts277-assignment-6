        <a href="#" style="color: gold">COVID-19</a> you can’t get it again or
        that the vaccines approved for emergency use will change your DNA or put
        a tracking device in your body. <br />

        It’s almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of
        the misinformation. But despite all the myths and urban legends, about
        half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.

        So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still
        possible for them to spread COVID-19 to others? Infectious disease
        specialist Lyssette Cardona, MD, answers those questions and covers why
